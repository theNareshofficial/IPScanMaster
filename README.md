# Key Concepts üîë

## Check IP Reachability
- This function checks if the given IP address responds to ping requests.

## Reverse Lookup for IP & DNS
- This function retrieves the original IP or DNS name. For example, 8.8.8.8 -> dns.google.com.

## WAF Detection
- Checks for the presence of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) on the IP address.

## Port Scanning
- Scans mentioned open ports, covering 85 advanced common ports to identify open ports quickly.

## SubDomain Lister
- This function identifies and lists all subdomains associated with the given domain. This can help in uncovering additional points of entry or services running under the main domain.

## IPINFO.io API
- Retrieves detailed information such as IP, city, region, country, location, organization, and timezone.

## WHOIS
- Executes WHOIS command to fetch additional details about the IP address.
